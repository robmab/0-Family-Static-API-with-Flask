# Family Jackson RAM API with Flask 

![Proyecto sin título](https://github.com/robmab/Family_RAM_API/assets/56076087/841a570f-88d8-4df2-b156-7a1189925d3b)

This is an API made in local RAM with 3 main endpoints, so everything is stored at the moment without a database

### Features
- **Visualise all members** of a given family, or individually
- **Add a new member** to the family. As indispensable, you must give the **first name**, plus all the extra information you want to give it. The **id** will be generated automatically, unless a specific one is given and does not exist previously
- **Delete a member** if exists, by id
